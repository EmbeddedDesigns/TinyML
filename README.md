# TinyML
This will be the place where all my work is stored on researching and creating Machine Learning for microprocessors and other end systems.

TinyML is meant to remove the machine learning model from the cloud and have the model stored on the end system that is out in the field. These end systems can be as tiny as arduino boards that have only kilobytes of memory! When done correctly, you can have machine learning models placed anywhere you need in order to help serve you or your customers with the life going on around you. I personally feel this is a giant evolutionary step and I am excited to learn as much as possible about it and also create my own designs using it.
